Houdini add-on for Sublime Text:
    https://github.com/teared/VEX


Release 7.1.6


1. Fixed internal deadlock caused by too many error messages:

    VCC process waits for the OS pipe buffer to accept more data,
    which caused the add-on stuck in the "VCC is currently running..." state.

    The deadlock may have caused files to get stuck in the temp folder.
    Temporary filename pattern: tmpxxxxxx

2. Added compilation timeout of 30 seconds.
