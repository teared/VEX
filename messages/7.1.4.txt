Release 7.1.4


1. Various Syntax Checker fixes:

    It now works on Linux machines:
        https://github.com/teared/VEX/issues/11

    Fixed a few bugs causing "VCC is currently running..."
    state stuck until the editor restarted.

    Temporary files used with "As a Snippet" build now removed sooner.
    An exception could cause files to get stuck in the temp folder.
    Temporary filename pattern: tmpxxxxxx

    Several more VCC errors are displayed.

    Improved Snippet error detection of bad "@" symbol usages.

    See "Optional: Configure VCC Path" and "Syntax Check"
    sections of the readme for the relevant info:
