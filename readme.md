## Setup

Preferences → Package Control → Install Package → VEX

Requirements:
1. Recent version of [Sublime Text].
2. [Package Control]

   Tools → Install Package Control

You should be able to use the add-on now. Skip all "Optional" sections below
if you are first-time user. Read them if you want to use more advanced
features.

[Package Control]: https://packagecontrol.io/


### Optional: Set as External Editor

Create `EDITOR` variable in your [houdini.env] and set it to Sublime Text
executable path.

Example file location on Windows:

    C:\Users\teared\Documents\houdini19.0\houdini.env

Example line to add to houdini.env (use *forward* slashes):

    EDITOR = "C:/Program Files/Sublime Text/sublime_text.exe"

Place cursor in any parameter field and press `Alt+E`,
then place cursor inside the built-in editor
and press `Alt+E` again to launch Sublime Text from Houdini.

[houdini.env]: https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/basics/config_env#setting-environment-variables


### Optional: Configure VCC Path

1. Tools → Build System → New Build System…
2. Remove default contents and copy-paste [VEX Build] file here.
3. Change value of `executable` setting to existing VCC executable path.

   Example setting for Windows:

       "executable": "C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 19.0.383\bin\vcc.exe",

4. Save to *[Data]*/Packages/User/`Any Name`.sublime-build

   To override default, save it
   to *Data*/Packages/VEX/prefs/VEX Build.sublime-build

**Alternatively**, add Houdini binaries dir to the `PATH`
environment variable. By default, the add-on uses `vcc` command.

See "Syntax Check" section of this readme.

### Optional: [HScript add-on]

Similar add-on for HScript and HScript Expressions languages. Syntax,
auto-completions, documentation popups. It used by the VEX add-on for
backtick-expressions embedded inside snippets.


### Optional: Other Tools

Some tools I use to work on Houdini projects using Sublime Text.

* [Monolit] — Sublime Text 3.0 latest "Monokai" turned into "1337" color
  scheme. Better scopes from Monokai and greater color palette from 1337.
  Greatly affects default Markdown syntax highlighting.
* [SublimeAStyleFormatter] — format messy code for easier reading.
  [My settings].
* [Anaconda] — add-on that covers all Python scripting needs, including HOM
  scripting for Houdini.

## Usage

Open any VEX code and choose VEX using menu at the right bottom corner of
the editor. By default, it will be automatically set on all `.vfl` files.
If you don't want to change from ANSI C to VEX every time you open some VEX
library with `.h` extension, there is "Open all with current extension as..."
action in the same menu.

When you start to type VEX function name, it will prompt you with suggestions.
You can choose one and use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keys to navigate back and
forth. Snippets are also available for common keywords: if, else, for,
foreach, while.

To show docs for the function:

Tools → Command Pallette → VEX: Show Documentation for Function Under Cursor

Shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+D`.

For the rest, check [Sublime Text Documentation], it has many small features
that make textual editing easy and powerful.

### Syntax Check

If you configured VCC path, you can do syntax check in the editor and see
errors. It doesn't require Houdini to run on background.

Tools → Build With... →

* VEX Build

  Use this variant if you write a custom shader and define context function
  with return type like: surface, displace, cvex, etc. This is what VCC
  expects by default, and probably least useful for Houdini user this days.

* VEX Build — As a Library

  If you write a custom library to include it in your code.

* VEX Build — As a Snippet

  If you write wrangle. Most common choice.

See some [code examples] in the add-on development repo.

[code examples]: https://github.com/teared/packages-dev/tree/master/develop/test_vex_build

VCC has no idea about attribute bindings, libraries got automatically compiled
within CVEX context, snippets are just functions internally, and VCC does not
expect to see a surface shader there. Therefore three variants. So, if you try
to do syntax check and error messages make a little sense, like this:

> Error 1092: Cannot compile VEX library; source file's context 'surface'
> does not match required context 'cvex'.
>
> Error 1040: Invalid return type (surface) for function my_function_name.
>
> Error 1091: Invalid context name 'float'
>
> Error 1088: Syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting '('
>
> Error 1088: Syntax error, unexpected identifier, expecting ';'

Check if correct build variant is used. Error 1088 is a common error, but in
case of wrong build variant chosen, there won't be visible syntax problems.
